# Introducing Blockchain

Blockchain is a continuously growing list of records, called blocks, which are linked and secured using cryptography. A blockchain is an immutable data structure, sequential chain of records called Blocks. Each block can contain transactions, files or any data you like. It is possible to create a digital ledger of data and share it among a network of independent parties.

There are many different types of blockchains.

- Public blockchains: Public blockchains, such as Bitcoin, are large distributed networks that are run through a native token. They’re open for anyone to participate at any level and have open-source code that their community maintains.

* Permissioned blockchains: Permissioned blockchains, such as Ripple, control roles that individuals can play within the network. They’re still large and distributed systems that use a native token. Their core code may or may not be open source.

* Private blockchains: Private blockchains tend to be smaller and do not utilize a token. Their membership is closely controlled. These types of blockchains are favored by consortiums that have trusted members and trade confidential information.
