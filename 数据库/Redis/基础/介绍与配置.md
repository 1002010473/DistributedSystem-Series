# Redis 介绍与配置

由于 Redis 截至目前是单线程运行，因此 Redis 即使在多核计算机上也是只能用到一核。

## Mechanism | 原理概述

我们在使用 Redis 的时候，通常是多个客户端连接 Redis 服务器，然后各自发送命令请求(例如 Get、Set)到 Redis 服务器，最后 Redis 处理这些请求返回结果。
![](http://www.dengshenyu.com/assets/redis-reactor/redis-mode.png)
Redis 除了处理客户端的命令请求还有诸如 RDB 持久化、AOF 重写这样的事情要做，而在做这些事情的时候，Redis 会 fork 子进程去完成。但对于 accept 客户端连接、处理客户端请求、返回命令结果等等这些，Redis 是使用主进程及主线程来完成的。
Redis 如此高效的原因就是其使用了 IO 多路复用的模式--Reactor。首先，Redis 服务器中有两类事件，文件事件和时间事件。

- 文件事件(file event)：Redis 客户端通过 socket 与 Redis 服务器连接，而文件事件就是服务器对套接字操作的抽象。例如，客户端发了一个 GET 命令请求，对于 Redis 服务器来说就是一个文件事件。
- 时间事件(time event)：服务器定时或周期性执行的事件。例如，定期执行 RDB 持久化。在这里我们主要关注 Redis 处理文件事件的模型。参考《Redis 的设计与实现》，Redis 的文件事件处理模型是这样的：

![](http://www.dengshenyu.com/assets/redis-reactor/redis-reactor.png)

在这个模型中，Redis 服务器用主线程执行 IO 多路复用程序、文件事件分派器以及事件处理器。而且，尽管多个文件事件可能会并发出现，Redis 服务器是顺序处理各个文件事件的。Redis 服务器主线程的执行流程在 Redis.c 的 main 函数中体现，而关于处理文件事件的主要的有这几行：

```
int main(int argc, char **argv) {
    ...
    initServer();
    ...
    aeMain();
    ...
    aeDeleteEventLoop(server.el);
    return 0;
}
```

在 initServer()中，建立各个事件处理器；在 aeMain()中，执行事件处理循环；在 aeDeleteEventLoop(server.el)中关闭停止事件处理循环；最后退出。

# Quick Start

## Installation

Redis 的安装还是比较简单的，直接从官网下载好安装包进行编译即可：

```shell
tar zxvf redis-2.8.9.tar.gz
cd redis-2.8.9
#直接make 编译
make
#可使用root用户执行`make install`，将可执行文件拷贝到/usr/local/bin目录下。这样就可以直接敲名字运行程序了。
make install
```

## Launch

一般来说，Redis 的启动方式有三种：

### 直接启动

```shell
#加上`&`号使redis以后台程序方式运行
./redis-server &

#检测后台进程是否存在
ps -ef |grep redis

#检测6379端口是否在监听
netstat -lntp | grep 6379

#使用`redis-cli`客户端检测连接是否正常
./redis-cli
127.0.0.1:6379> keys *
(empty list or set)
127.0.0.1:6379> set key "hello world"
OK
127.0.0.1:6379> get key
"hello world"

#使用客户端
redis-cli shutdown
#因为Redis可以妥善处理SIGTERM信号，所以直接kill -9也是可以的
kill -9 PID
```

### 使用指定配置文件启动

    可为redis服务启动指定配置文件，配置文件    `redis.conf`    在Redis根目录下。

```
#修改daemonize为yes，即默认以后台程序方式运行(还记得前面手动使用&号强制后台运行吗)。
daemonize no
#可修改默认监听端口
port 6379
#修改生成默认日志文件位置
logfile "/home/futeng/logs/redis.log"
#配置持久化文件存放位置
dir /home/futeng/data/redisData
```

启动时指定配置文件

```
redis-server ./redis.conf
#如果更改了端口，使用`redis-cli`客户端连接时，也需要指定端口，例如：
redis-cli -p 6380
```

    其他启停同    *直接启动*    方式。配置文件是非常重要的配置工具，随着使用的逐渐深入将显得尤为重要，推荐在一开始就使用配置文件。

### 使用 Redis 启动脚本设置开机自启动

    推荐在生产环境中使用启动脚本方式启动redis服务。启动脚本    `redis_init_script`    位于位于Redis的    `/utils/`    目录下。

```shell
#大致浏览下该启动脚本，发现redis习惯性用监听的端口名作为配置文件等命名，我们后面也遵循这个约定。
#redis服务器监听的端口
REDISPORT=6379
#服务端所处位置，在make install后默认存放与`/usr/local/bin/redis-server`，如果未make install则需要修改该路径，下同。
EXEC=/usr/local/bin/redis-server
#客户端位置
CLIEXEC=/usr/local/bin/redis-cli
#Redis的PID文件位置
PIDFILE=/var/run/redis_${REDISPORT}.pid
#配置文件位置，需要修改
CONF="/etc/redis/${REDISPORT}.conf"
```

    \1. 根据启动脚本要求，将修改好的配置文件以端口为名复制一份到指定目录。需使用root用户。

```
mkdir /etc/redis
cp redis.conf /etc/redis/6379.conf
```

1.  将启动脚本复制到/etc/init.d 目录下，本例将启动脚本命名为 redisd(通常都以 d 结尾表示是后台自启动服务)。

```
cp redis_init_script /etc/init.d/redisd
```

     3.           设置为开机自启动

    **

      此处直接配置开启自启动      chkconfig redisd on

      将报错误:      service redisd does not support chkconfig

    **

    参照

    [此篇文章](http://www.cnblogs.com/goodspeed/archive/2012/10/18/2729615.html)

    ，在启动脚本开头添加如下两行注释以修改其运行级别：

```
#!/bin/sh
# chkconfig:   2345 90 10
# description:  Redis is a persistent key-value database
#
```

再设置即可成功。

```
#设置为开机自启动服务器
chkconfig redisd on
#打开服务
service redisd start
#关闭服务
service redisd stop
```

## Command

基本的连接到 redis 客户端的方式：

```shell
redis-cli -h 127.0.0.1 -p 6379 -a myRedis
redis 127.0.0.1:6379> keys *
1) "myset"
2) "mysortset"
redis 127.0.0.1:6379> select 1
OK
redis 127.0.0.1:6379[1]> config get requirepass
1) "requirepass"
2) "myRedis"
```

```

- Using in a Rails application

Add to Gemfile:

```
gem 'redmon', require: false
```

Mount redmon in config/routes.rb:

```
mount Redmon::App => '/redmon'
```

Create a config/initializers/redmon.rb file:

```
require 'redmon/config'
require 'redmon/redis'
require 'redmon/app'

#
# Optional config overrides
#
Redmon.configure do |config|
  config.redis_url = 'redis://127.0.0.1:6379'
  config.namespace = 'redmon'
end
```

This will mount the Redmon application to the /redmon path.

- [](https://github.com/steelThread/redmon#stats-worker)Stats worker

The worker that gathers the Redis info stats will not be started when Redmon is mounted like this. In order to get a EventMachine worker running inside your Rails app you can try this [Railtie based approach](https://github.com/steelThread/redmon/pull/19#issuecomment-7273659). If you are using a system to execute background tasks in your app (like Sidekiq, Resque, or Delayed Job), you can write your own worker to update the info stats.

A simple worker for Sidekiq looks like this:

```
class RedmonWorker
  include Sidekiq::Worker

  def perform
    worker = Redmon::Worker.new
    worker.record_stats
    worker.cleanup_old_stats
  ensure
    self.class.perform_in Redmon.config.poll_interval.seconds
  end
end
```

Once enqueued, the worker updates the stats and automatically enqueues itself to be performed again after the defined poll interval.

# Configuration

| 配置名    | 说明                                                                                                 | 示范               |
| --------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------ |
| daemonize | Redis 默认不是以守护进程的方式运行，可以通过该配置项修改，使用 yes 启用守护进程                      | no/yes             |
| pidfile   | 当 Redis 以守护进程方式运行时，Redis 默认会把 pid 写入/var/run/redis.pid 文件，可以通过 pidfile 指定 | /var/run/redis.pid |
|           |                                                                                                      |                    |

3.指定 Redis 监听端口，默认端口为 6379，作者在自己的一篇博文中解释了为什么选用 6379 作为默认端口，因为 6379 在手机按键上 MERZ 对应的号码，而 MERZ 取自意大利歌女 Alessia Merz 的名字

    **port 6379**

\4. 绑定的主机地址

    **bind 127.0.0.1**

5.当 客户端闲置多长时间后关闭连接，如果指定为 0，表示关闭该功能

    **timeout 300**

\6. 指定日志记录级别，Redis 总共支持四个级别：debug、verbose、notice、warning，默认为 verbose

    **loglevel verbose**

\7. 日志记录方式，默认为标准输出，如果配置 Redis 为守护进程方式运行，而这里又配置为日志记录方式为标准输出，则日志将会发送给/dev/null

    **logfile stdout**

\8. 设置数据库的数量，默认数据库为 0，可以使用 SELECT <dbid>命令在连接上指定数据库 id

    **databases 16**

\9. 指定在多长时间内，有多少次更新操作，就将数据同步到数据文件，可以多个条件配合

    **save  **

    Redis默认配置文件中提供了三个条件：

    **save 900 1**

** save 300 10**

** save 60 10000**

    分别表示900秒(15分钟)内有1个更改，300秒(5分钟)内有10个更改以及60秒内有10000个更改。

\10. 指定存储至本地数据库时是否压缩数据，默认为 yes，Redis 采用 LZF 压缩，如果为了节省 CPU 时间，可以关闭该选项，但会导致数据库文件变的巨大

    **rdbcompression yes**

\11. 指定本地数据库文件名，默认值为 dump.rdb

    **dbfilename dump.rdb**

\12. 指定本地数据库存放目录

    **dir ./**

\13. 设置当本机为 slav 服务时，设置 master 服务的 IP 地址及端口，在 Redis 启动时，它会自动从 master 进行数据同步

    **slaveof  **

\14. 当 master 服务设置了密码保护时，slav 服务连接 master 的密码

    **masterauth **

\15. 设置 Redis 连接密码，如果配置了连接密码，客户端在连接 Redis 时需要通过 AUTH <password>命令提供密码，默认关闭

    **requirepass foobared**

\16. 设置同一时间最大客户端连接数，默认无限制，Redis 可以同时打开的客户端连接数为 Redis 进程可以打开的最大文件描述符数，如果设置 maxclients 0，表示不作限制。当客户端连接数到达限制时，Redis 会关闭新的连接并向客户端返回 max number of clients reached 错误信息

    **maxclients 128**

\17. 指定 Redis 最大内存限制，Redis 在启动时会把数据加载到内存中，达到最大内存后，Redis 会先尝试清除已到期或即将到期的 Key，当此方法处理 后，仍然到达最大内存设置，将无法再进行写入操作，但仍然可以进行读取操作。Redis 新的 vm 机制，会把 Key 存放内存，Value 会存放在 swap 区

    **maxmemory **

\18. 指定是否在每次更新操作后进行日志记录，Redis 在默认情况下是异步的把数据写入磁盘，如果不开启，可能会在断电时导致一段时间内的数据丢失。因为 redis 本身同步数据文件是按上面 save 条件来同步的，所以有的数据会在一段时间内只存在于内存中。默认为 no

    **appendonly no**

\19. 指定更新日志文件名，默认为 appendonly.aof

     **appendfilename appendonly.aof**

\20. 指定更新日志条件，共有 3 个可选值：

     **no**：表示等操作系统进行数据缓存同步到磁盘(快)

     **always**：表示每次更新操作后手动调用fsync()将数据写到磁盘(慢，安全)

     **everysec**：表示每秒同步一次(折衷，默认值)

    **appendfsync everysec**

\21. 指定是否启用虚拟内存机制，默认值为 no，简单的介绍一下，VM 机制将数据分页存放，由 Redis 将访问量较少的页即冷数据 swap 到磁盘上，访问多的页面由磁盘自动换出到内存中(在后面的文章我会仔细分析 Redis 的 VM 机制)

     **vm-enabled no**

\22. 虚拟内存文件路径，默认值为/tmp/redis.swap，不可多个 Redis 实例共享

     **vm-swap-file /tmp/redis.swap**

\23. 将所有大于 vm-max-memory 的数据存入虚拟内存,无论 vm-max-memory 设置多小,所有索引数据都是内存存储的(Redis 的索引数据 就是 keys),也就是说,当 vm-max-memory 设置为 0 的时候,其实是所有 value 都存在于磁盘。默认值为 0

     **vm-max-memory 0**

\24. Redis swap 文件分成了很多的 page，一个对象可以保存在多个 page 上面，但一个 page 上不能被多个对象共享，vm-page-size 是要根据存储的 数据大小来设定的，作者建议如果存储很多小对象，page 大小最好设置为 32 或者 64bytes；如果存储很大大对象，则可以使用更大的 page，如果不 确定，就使用默认值

     **vm-page-size 32**

\25. 设置 swap 文件中的 page 数量，由于页表(一种表示页面空闲或使用的 bitmap)是在放在内存中的，，在磁盘上每 8 个 pages 将消耗 1byte 的内存。

     **vm-pages 134217728**

\26. 设置访问 swap 文件的线程数,最好不要超过机器的核数,如果设置为 0,那么所有对 swap 文件的操作都是串行的，可能会造成比较长时间的延迟。默认值为 4

     **vm-max-threads 4**

\27. 设置在向客户端应答时，是否把较小的包合并为一个包发送，默认为开启

    **glueoutputbuf yes**

\28. 指定在超过一定的数量或者最大的元素超过某一临界值时，采用一种特殊的哈希算法

    **hash-max-zipmap-entries 64**

** hash-max-zipmap-value 512**

\29. 指定是否激活重置哈希，默认为开启(后面在介绍 Redis 的哈希算法时具体介绍)

    **activerehashing yes**

\30. 指定包含其它的配置文件，可以在同一主机上多个 Redis 实例之间使用同一份配置文件，而同时各个实例又拥有自己的特定配置文件

    **include /path/to/local.conf**

```shell
# Redis configuration file example.
#
# Note that in order to read the configuration file, Redis must be
# started with the file path as first argument:
#
# ./redis-server /path/to/redis.conf

# Note on units: when memory size is needed, it is possible to specify
# it in the usual form of 1k 5GB 4M and so forth:
#
# 1k => 1000 bytes
# 1kb => 1024 bytes
# 1m => 1000000 bytes
# 1mb => 1024*1024 bytes
# 1g => 1000000000 bytes
# 1gb => 1024*1024*1024 bytes
#
# units are case insensitive so 1GB 1Gb 1gB are all the same.

################################## INCLUDES ###################################

# Include one or more other config files here.  This is useful if you
# have a standard template that goes to all Redis servers but also need
# to customize a few per-server settings.  Include files can include
# other files, so use this wisely.
#
# Notice option "include" won't be rewritten by command "CONFIG REWRITE"
# from admin or Redis Sentinel. Since Redis always uses the last processed
# line as value of a configuration directive, you'd better put includes
# at the beginning of this file to avoid overwriting config change at runtime.
#
# If instead you are interested in using includes to override configuration
# options, it is better to use include as the last line.

################################ GENERAL  #####################################

# By default Redis does not run as a daemon. Use 'yes' if you need it.
# Note that Redis will write a pid file in /var/run/redis.pid when daemonized.
daemonize no

# When running daemonized, Redis writes a pid file in /var/run/redis.pid by
# default. You can specify a custom pid file location here.
pidfile /var/run/redis.pid

# Accept connections on the specified port, default is 6379.
# If port 0 is specified Redis will not listen on a TCP socket.
port 6379

# TCP listen() backlog.
#
# In high requests-per-second environments you need an high backlog in order
# to avoid slow clients connections issues. Note that the Linux kernel
# will silently truncate it to the value of /proc/sys/net/core/somaxconn so
# make sure to raise both the value of somaxconn and tcp_max_syn_backlog
# in order to get the desired effect.
tcp-backlog 511

# By default Redis listens for connections from all the network interfaces
# available on the server. It is possible to listen to just one or multiple
# interfaces using the "bind" configuration directive, followed by one or
# more IP addresses.
#
# Examples:
#
# bind 192.168.1.100 10.0.0.1
# bind 127.0.0.1

# Specify the path for the Unix socket that will be used to listen for
# incoming connections. There is no default, so Redis will not listen
# on a unix socket when not specified.
#
# unixsocket /tmp/redis.sock
# unixsocketperm 700

# Close the connection after a client is idle for N seconds (0 to disable)
timeout 0

# TCP keepalive.
#
# If non-zero, use SO_KEEPALIVE to send TCP ACKs to clients in absence
# of communication. This is useful for two reasons:
#
# 1) Detect dead peers.
# 2) Take the connection alive from the point of view of network
#    equipment in the middle.
#
# On Linux, the specified value (in seconds) is the period used to send ACKs.
# Note that to close the connection the double of the time is needed.
# On other kernels the period depends on the kernel configuration.
#
# A reasonable value for this option is 60 seconds.
tcp-keepalive 0

# Specify the server verbosity level.
# This can be one of:
# debug (a lot of information, useful for development/testing)
# verbose (many rarely useful info, but not a mess like the debug level)
# notice (moderately verbose, what you want in production probably)
# warning (only very important / critical messages are logged)
loglevel notice

# Specify the log file name. Also the empty string can be used to force
# Redis to log on the standard output. Note that if you use standard
# output for logging but daemonize, logs will be sent to /dev/null
logfile ""

# To enable logging to the system logger, just set 'syslog-enabled' to yes,
# and optionally update the other syslog parameters to suit your needs.
# syslog-enabled no

# Specify the syslog identity.
# syslog-ident redis

# Specify the syslog facility. Must be USER or between LOCAL0-LOCAL7.
# syslog-facility local0

# Set the number of databases. The default database is DB 0, you can select
# a different one on a per-connection basis using SELECT <dbid> where
# dbid is a number between 0 and 'databases'-1

################################ SNAPSHOTTING  ################################
#
# Save the DB on disk:
#
#   save <seconds> <changes>
#
#   Will save the DB if both the given number of seconds and the given
#   number of write operations against the DB occurred.
#
#   In the example below the behaviour will be to save:
#   after 900 sec (15 min) if at least 1 key changed
#   after 300 sec (5 min) if at least 10 keys changed
#   after 60 sec if at least 10000 keys changed
#
#   Note: you can disable saving completely by commenting out all "save" lines.
#
#   It is also possible to remove all the previously configured save
#   points by adding a save directive with a single empty string argument
#   like in the following example:
#
#   save ""

save 900 1
save 300 10
save 60 10000

# By default Redis will stop accepting writes if RDB snapshots are enabled
# (at least one save point) and the latest background save failed.
# This will make the user aware (in a hard way) that data is not persisting
# on disk properly, otherwise chances are that no one will notice and some
# disaster will happen.
#
# If the background saving process will start working again Redis will
# automatically allow writes again.
#
# However if you have setup your proper monitoring of the Redis server
# and persistence, you may want to disable this feature so that Redis will
# continue to work as usual even if there are problems with disk,
# permissions, and so forth.
stop-writes-on-bgsave-error yes

# Compress string objects using LZF when dump .rdb databases?
# For default that's set to 'yes' as it's almost always a win.
# If you want to save some CPU in the saving child set it to 'no' but
# the dataset will likely be bigger if you have compressible values or keys.
rdbcompression yes

# Since version 5 of RDB a CRC64 checksum is placed at the end of the file.
# This makes the format more resistant to corruption but there is a performance
# hit to pay (around 10%) when saving and loading RDB files, so you can disable it
# for maximum performances.
#
# RDB files created with checksum disabled have a checksum of zero that will
# tell the loading code to skip the check.
rdbchecksum yes

# The filename where to dump the DB
dbfilename dump.rdb

# The working directory.
#
# The DB will be written inside this directory, with the filename specified
# above using the 'dbfilename' configuration directive.
#
# The Append Only File will also be created inside this directory.
#
# Note that you must specify a directory here, not a file name.
dir ./

################################# REPLICATION #################################

# Master-Slave replication. Use slaveof to make a Redis instance a copy of
# another Redis server. A few things to understand ASAP about Redis replication.
#
# 1) Redis replication is asynchronous, but you can configure a master to
#    stop accepting writes if it appears to be not connected with at least
#    a given number of slaves.
# 2) Redis slaves are able to perform a partial resynchronization with the
#    master if the replication link is lost for a relatively small amount of
#    time. You may want to configure the replication backlog size (see the next
#    sections of this file) with a sensible value depending on your needs.
# 3) Replication is automatic and does not need user intervention. After a
#    network partition slaves automatically try to reconnect to masters
#    and resynchronize with them.
#
# slaveof <masterip> <masterport>

# If the master is password protected (using the "requirepass" configuration
# directive below) it is possible to tell the slave to authenticate before
# starting the replication synchronization process, otherwise the master will
# refuse the slave request.
#
# masterauth <master-password>

# When a slave loses its connection with the master, or when the replication
# is still in progress, the slave can act in two different ways:
#
# 1) if slave-serve-stale-data is set to 'yes' (the default) the slave will
#    still reply to client requests, possibly with out of date data, or the
#    data set may just be empty if this is the first synchronization.
#
# 2) if slave-serve-stale-data is set to 'no' the slave will reply with
#    an error "SYNC with master in progress" to all the kind of commands
#    but to INFO and SLAVEOF.
#
slave-serve-stale-data yes

# You can configure a slave instance to accept writes or not. Writing against
# a slave instance may be useful to store some ephemeral data (because data
# written on a slave will be easily deleted after resync with the master) but
# may also cause problems if clients are writing to it because of a
# misconfiguration.
#
# Since Redis 2.6 by default slaves are read-only.
#
# Note: read only slaves are not designed to be exposed to untrusted clients
# on the internet. It's just a protection layer against misuse of the instance.
# Still a read only slave exports by default all the administrative commands
# such as CONFIG, DEBUG, and so forth. To a limited extent you can improve
# security of read only slaves using 'rename-command' to shadow all the
# administrative / dangerous commands.

# Replication SYNC strategy: disk or socket.
#
# -------------------------------------------------------
# WARNING: DISKLESS REPLICATION IS EXPERIMENTAL CURRENTLY
# -------------------------------------------------------
#
# New slaves and reconnecting slaves that are not able to continue the replication
# process just receiving differences, need to do what is called a "full
# synchronization". An RDB file is transmitted from the master to the slaves.
# The transmission can happen in two different ways:
#
# 1) Disk-backed: The Redis master creates a new process that writes the RDB
#                 file on disk. Later the file is transferred by the parent
#                 process to the slaves incrementally.
# 2) Diskless: The Redis master creates a new process that directly writes the
#              RDB file to slave sockets, without touching the disk at all.
#
# With disk-backed replication, while the RDB file is generated, more slaves
# can be queued and served with the RDB file as soon as the current child producing
# the RDB file finishes its work. With diskless replication instead once
# the transfer starts, new slaves arriving will be queued and a new transfer
# will start when the current one terminates.
#
# When diskless replication is used, the master waits a configurable amount of
# time (in seconds) before starting the transfer in the hope that multiple slaves
# will arrive and the transfer can be parallelized.
#
# With slow disks and fast (large bandwidth) networks, diskless replication
# works better.
repl-diskless-sync no

# When diskless replication is enabled, it is possible to configure the delay
# the server waits in order to spawn the child that transfers the RDB via socket
# to the slaves.
#
# This is important since once the transfer starts, it is not possible to serve
# new slaves arriving, that will be queued for the next RDB transfer, so the server
# waits a delay in order to let more slaves arrive.
#
# The delay is specified in seconds, and by default is 5 seconds. To disable
# it entirely just set it to 0 seconds and the transfer will start ASAP.
repl-diskless-sync-delay 5

# Slaves send PINGs to server in a predefined interval. It's possible to change
# this interval with the repl_ping_slave_period option. The default value is 10
# seconds.
#
# repl-ping-slave-period 10

# The following option sets the replication timeout for:
#
# 1) Bulk transfer IO during SYNC, from the point of view of slave.
# 2) Master timeout from the point of view of slaves (data, pings).
# 3) Slave timeout from the point of view of masters (REPLCONF ACK pings).
#
# It is important to make sure that this value is greater than the value
# specified for repl-ping-slave-period otherwise a timeout will be detected
# every time there is low traffic between the master and the slave.
#
# repl-timeout 60

# Disable TCP_NODELAY on the slave socket after SYNC?
#
# If you select "yes" Redis will use a smaller number of TCP packets and
# less bandwidth to send data to slaves. But this can add a delay for
# the data to appear on the slave side, up to 40 milliseconds with
# Linux kernels using a default configuration.
#
# If you select "no" the delay for data to appear on the slave side will
# be reduced but more bandwidth will be used for replication.
#
# By default we optimize for low latency, but in very high traffic conditions
# or when the master and slaves are many hops away, turning this to "yes" may
# be a good idea.
repl-disable-tcp-nodelay no

# Set the replication backlog size. The backlog is a buffer that accumulates
# slave data when slaves are disconnected for some time, so that when a slave
# wants to reconnect again, often a full resync is not needed, but a partial
# resync is enough, just passing the portion of data the slave missed while
# disconnected.
#
# The bigger the replication backlog, the longer the time the slave can be
# disconnected and later be able to perform a partial resynchronization.
#
# The backlog is only allocated once there is at least a slave connected.
#
# repl-backlog-size 1mb

# After a master has no longer connected slaves for some time, the backlog
# will be freed. The following option configures the amount of seconds that
# need to elapse, starting from the time the last slave disconnected, for
# the backlog buffer to be freed.
#
# A value of 0 means to never release the backlog.
#
# repl-backlog-ttl 3600

# The slave priority is an integer number published by Redis in the INFO output.
# It is used by Redis Sentinel in order to select a slave to promote into a
# master if the master is no longer working correctly.
#
# A slave with a low priority number is considered better for promotion, so
# for instance if there are three slaves with priority 10, 100, 25 Sentinel will
# pick the one with priority 10, that is the lowest.
#
# However a special priority of 0 marks the slave as not able to perform the
# role of master, so a slave with priority of 0 will never be selected by
# Redis Sentinel for promotion.
#
# By default the priority is 100.
slave-priority 100

# It is possible for a master to stop accepting writes if there are less than
# N slaves connected, having a lag less or equal than M seconds.
#
# The N slaves need to be in "online" state.
#
# The lag in seconds, that must be <= the specified value, is calculated from
# the last ping received from the slave, that is usually sent every second.
#
# This option does not GUARANTEE that N replicas will accept the write, but
# will limit the window of exposure for lost writes in case not enough slaves
# are available, to the specified number of seconds.
#
# For example to require at least 3 slaves with a lag <= 10 seconds use:
#
# min-slaves-to-write 3
# min-slaves-max-lag 10
#
# Setting one or the other to 0 disables the feature.
#
# By default min-slaves-to-write is set to 0 (feature disabled) and
# min-slaves-max-lag is set to 10.

################################## SECURITY ###################################

# Require clients to issue AUTH <PASSWORD> before processing any other

# others with access to the host running redis-server.
#
# This should stay commented out for backward compatibility and because most

#
# Warning: since Redis is pretty fast an outside user can try up to

# use a very strong password otherwise it will be very easy to break.
#
# requirepass foobared

# Command renaming.
#
# It is possible to change the name of dangerous commands in a shared
# environment. For instance the CONFIG command may be renamed into something
# hard to guess so that it will still be available for internal-use tools
# but not available for general clients.
#
# Example:
#
# rename-command CONFIG b840fc02d524045429941cc15f59e41cb7be6c52
#
# It is also possible to completely kill a command by renaming it into
# an empty string:
#
# rename-command CONFIG ""
#
# Please note that changing the name of commands that are logged into the
# AOF file or transmitted to slaves may cause problems.

################################### LIMITS ####################################

# Set the max number of connected clients at the same time. By default
# this limit is set to 10000 clients, however if the Redis server is not
# able to configure the process file limit to allow for the specified limit
# the max number of allowed clients is set to the current file limit
# minus 32 (as Redis reserves a few file descriptors for internal uses).
#
# Once the limit is reached Redis will close all the new connections sending
# an error 'max number of clients reached'.
#
# maxclients 10000

# Don't use more memory than the specified amount of bytes.
# When the memory limit is reached Redis will try to remove keys
# according to the eviction policy selected (see maxmemory-policy).
#
# If Redis can't remove keys according to the policy, or if the policy is
# set to 'noeviction', Redis will start to reply with errors to commands
# that would use more memory, like SET, LPUSH, and so on, and will continue
# to reply to read-only commands like GET.
#
# This option is usually useful when using Redis as an LRU cache, or to set
# a hard memory limit for an instance (using the 'noeviction' policy).
#
# WARNING: If you have slaves attached to an instance with maxmemory on,
# the size of the output buffers needed to feed the slaves are subtracted
# from the used memory count, so that network problems / resyncs will
# not trigger a loop where keys are evicted, and in turn the output
# buffer of slaves is full with DELs of keys evicted triggering the deletion
# of more keys, and so forth until the database is completely emptied.
#
# In short... if you have slaves attached it is suggested that you set a lower
# limit for maxmemory so that there is some free RAM on the system for slave
# output buffers (but this is not needed if the policy is 'noeviction').
#
# maxmemory <bytes>

# MAXMEMORY POLICY: how Redis will select what to remove when maxmemory
# is reached. You can select among five behaviors:
#
# volatile-lru -> remove the key with an expire set using an LRU algorithm
# allkeys-lru -> remove any key according to the LRU algorithm
# volatile-random -> remove a random key with an expire set
# allkeys-random -> remove a random key, any key
# volatile-ttl -> remove the key with the nearest expire time (minor TTL)
# noeviction -> don't expire at all, just return an error on write operations
#
# Note: with any of the above policies, Redis will return an error on write
#       operations, when there are no suitable keys for eviction.
#
#       At the date of writing these commands are: set setnx setex append
#       incr decr rpush lpush rpushx lpushx linsert lset rpoplpush sadd
#       sinter sinterstore sunion sunionstore sdiff sdiffstore zadd zincrby
#       zunionstore zinterstore hset hsetnx hmset hincrby incrby decrby
#       getset mset msetnx exec sort
#
# The default is:
#
# maxmemory-policy noeviction

# LRU and minimal TTL algorithms are not precise algorithms but approximated
# algorithms (in order to save memory), so you can tune it for speed or
# accuracy. For default Redis will check five keys and pick the one that was
# used less recently, you can change the sample size using the following
# configuration directive.
#
# The default of 5 produces good enough results. 10 Approximates very closely
# true LRU but costs a bit more CPU. 3 is very fast but not very accurate.
#
# maxmemory-samples 5

############################## APPEND ONLY MODE ###############################

# By default Redis asynchronously dumps the dataset on disk. This mode is
# good enough in many applications, but an issue with the Redis process or
# a power outage may result into a few minutes of writes lost (depending on
# the configured save points).
#
# The Append Only File is an alternative persistence mode that provides
# much better durability. For instance using the default data fsync policy
# (see later in the config file) Redis can lose just one second of writes in a
# dramatic event like a server power outage, or a single write if something
# wrong with the Redis process itself happens, but the operating system is
# still running correctly.
#
# AOF and RDB persistence can be enabled at the same time without problems.
# If the AOF is enabled on startup Redis will load the AOF, that is the file
# with the better durability guarantees.
#
# Please check http://redis.io/topics/persistence for more information.

appendonly no

# The name of the append only file (default: "appendonly.aof")

appendfilename "appendonly.aof"

# The fsync() call tells the Operating System to actually write data on disk
# instead of waiting for more data in the output buffer. Some OS will really flush
# data on disk, some other OS will just try to do it ASAP.
#
# Redis supports three different modes:
#
# no: don't fsync, just let the OS flush the data when it wants. Faster.
# always: fsync after every write to the append only log. Slow, Safest.
# everysec: fsync only one time every second. Compromise.
#
# The default is "everysec", as that's usually the right compromise between
# speed and data safety. It's up to you to understand if you can relax this to
# "no" that will let the operating system flush the output buffer when
# it wants, for better performances (but if you can live with the idea of
# some data loss consider the default persistence mode that's snapshotting),
# or on the contrary, use "always" that's very slow but a bit safer than
# everysec.
#
# More details please check the following article:
# http://antirez.com/post/redis-persistence-demystified.html
#
# If unsure, use "everysec".

# appendfsync always
appendfsync everysec
# appendfsync no

# When the AOF fsync policy is set to always or everysec, and a background
# saving process (a background save or AOF log background rewriting) is
# performing a lot of IO against the disk, in some Linux configurations
# Redis may block too long on the fsync() call. Note that there is no fix for
# this currently, as even performing fsync in a different thread will block
# our synchronous write(2) call.
#
# In order to mitigate this problem it's possible to use the following option
# that will prevent fsync() from being called in the main process while a
# BGSAVE or BGREWRITEAOF is in progress.
#
# This means that while another child is saving, the durability of Redis is
# the same as "appendfsync none". In practical terms, this means that it is
# possible to lose up to 30 seconds of log in the worst scenario (with the
# default Linux settings).
#
# If you have latency problems turn this to "yes". Otherwise leave it as
# "no" that is the safest pick from the point of view of durability.

no-appendfsync-on-rewrite no

# Automatic rewrite of the append only file.
# Redis is able to automatically rewrite the log file implicitly calling
# BGREWRITEAOF when the AOF log size grows by the specified percentage.
#
# This is how it works: Redis remembers the size of the AOF file after the
# latest rewrite (if no rewrite has happened since the restart, the size of
# the AOF at startup is used).
#
# This base size is compared to the current size. If the current size is
# bigger than the specified percentage, the rewrite is triggered. Also
# you need to specify a minimal size for the AOF file to be rewritten, this
# is useful to avoid rewriting the AOF file even if the percentage increase
# is reached but it is still pretty small.
#
# Specify a percentage of zero in order to disable the automatic AOF
# rewrite feature.

auto-aof-rewrite-percentage 100
auto-aof-rewrite-min-size 64mb

# An AOF file may be found to be truncated at the end during the Redis
# startup process, when the AOF data gets loaded back into memory.
# This may happen when the system where Redis is running
# crashes, especially when an ext4 filesystem is mounted without the
# data=ordered option (however this can't happen when Redis itself
# crashes or aborts but the operating system still works correctly).
#
# Redis can either exit with an error when this happens, or load as much
# data as possible (the default now) and start if the AOF file is found
# to be truncated at the end. The following option controls this behavior.
#
# If aof-load-truncated is set to yes, a truncated AOF file is loaded and
# the Redis server starts emitting a log to inform the user of the event.
# Otherwise if the option is set to no, the server aborts with an error
# and refuses to start. When the option is set to no, the user requires
# to fix the AOF file using the "redis-check-aof" utility before to restart
# the server.
#
# Note that if the AOF file will be found to be corrupted in the middle
# the server will still exit with an error. This option only applies when
# Redis will try to read more data from the AOF file but not enough bytes
# will be found.
aof-load-truncated yes

################################ LUA SCRIPTING  ###############################

# Max execution time of a Lua script in milliseconds.
#
# If the maximum execution time is reached Redis will log that a script is
# still in execution after the maximum allowed time and will start to
# reply to queries with an error.
#
# When a long running script exceeds the maximum execution time only the
# SCRIPT KILL and SHUTDOWN NOSAVE commands are available. The first can be
# used to stop a script that did not yet called write commands. The second
# is the only way to shut down the server in the case a write command was
# already issued by the script but the user doesn't want to wait for the natural
# termination of the script.

# Set it to 0 or a negative value for unlimited execution without warnings.

################################ REDIS CLUSTER  ###############################
#
# ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
# WARNING EXPERIMENTAL: Redis Cluster is considered to be stable code, however
# in order to mark it as "mature" we need to wait for a non trivial percentage
# of users to deploy it in production.
# ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
#
# Normal Redis instances can't be part of a Redis Cluster; only nodes that are
# started as cluster nodes can. In order to start a Redis instance as a
# cluster node enable the cluster support uncommenting the following:
#
# cluster-enabled yes

# Every cluster node has a cluster configuration file. This file is not
# intended to be edited by hand. It is created and updated by Redis nodes.
# Every Redis Cluster node requires a different cluster configuration file.
# Make sure that instances running in the same system do not have
# overlapping cluster configuration file names.
#
# cluster-config-file nodes-6379.conf

# Cluster node timeout is the amount of milliseconds a node must be unreachable
# for it to be considered in failure state.
# Most other internal time limits are multiple of the node timeout.
#
# cluster-node-timeout 15000

# A slave of a failing master will avoid to start a failover if its data
# looks too old.
#
# There is no simple way for a slave to actually have a exact measure of
# its "data age", so the following two checks are performed:
#
# 1) If there are multiple slaves able to failover, they exchange messages
#    in order to try to give an advantage to the slave with the best
#    replication offset (more data from the master processed).
#    Slaves will try to get their rank by offset, and apply to the start
#    of the failover a delay proportional to their rank.
#
# 2) Every single slave computes the time of the last interaction with
#    its master. This can be the last ping or command received (if the master
#    is still in the "connected" state), or the time that elapsed since the
#    disconnection with the master (if the replication link is currently down).
#    If the last interaction is too old, the slave will not try to failover
#    at all.
#
# The point "2" can be tuned by user. Specifically a slave will not perform
# the failover if, since the last interaction with the master, the time
# elapsed is greater than:
#
#   (node-timeout * slave-validity-factor) + repl-ping-slave-period
#
# So for example if node-timeout is 30 seconds, and the slave-validity-factor
# is 10, and assuming a default repl-ping-slave-period of 10 seconds, the
# slave will not try to failover if it was not able to talk with the master
# for longer than 310 seconds.
#
# A large slave-validity-factor may allow slaves with too old data to failover
# a master, while a too small value may prevent the cluster from being able to
# elect a slave at all.
#
# For maximum availability, it is possible to set the slave-validity-factor
# to a value of 0, which means, that slaves will always try to failover the
# master regardless of the last time they interacted with the master.
# (However they'll always try to apply a delay proportional to their
# offset rank).
#
# Zero is the only value able to guarantee that when all the partitions heal
# the cluster will always be able to continue.
#
# cluster-slave-validity-factor 10

# Cluster slaves are able to migrate to orphaned masters, that are masters
# that are left without working slaves. This improves the cluster ability
# to resist to failures as otherwise an orphaned master can't be failed over
# in case of failure if it has no working slaves.
#
# Slaves migrate to orphaned masters only if there are still at least a
# given number of other working slaves for their old master. This number
# is the "migration barrier". A migration barrier of 1 means that a slave
# will migrate only if there is at least 1 other working slave for its master
# and so forth. It usually reflects the number of slaves you want for every
# master in your cluster.
#
# Default is 1 (slaves migrate only if their masters remain with at least
# one slave). To disable migration just set it to a very large value.
# A value of 0 can be set but is useful only for debugging and dangerous
# in production.
#
# cluster-migration-barrier 1

# By default Redis Cluster nodes stop accepting queries if they detect there
# is at least an hash slot uncovered (no available node is serving it).
# This way if the cluster is partially down (for example a range of hash slots
# are no longer covered) all the cluster becomes, eventually, unavailable.
# It automatically returns available as soon as all the slots are covered again.
#
# However sometimes you want the subset of the cluster which is working,
# to continue to accept queries for the part of the key space that is still
# covered. In order to do so, just set the cluster-require-full-coverage
# option to no.
#
# cluster-require-full-coverage yes

# In order to setup your cluster make sure to read the documentation
# available at http://redis.io web site.

################################## SLOW LOG ###################################

# The Redis Slow Log is a system to log queries that exceeded a specified
# execution time. The execution time does not include the IO operations
# like talking with the client, sending the reply and so forth,
# but just the time needed to actually execute the command (this is the only
# stage of command execution where the thread is blocked and can not serve
# other requests in the meantime).
#
# You can configure the slow log with two parameters: one tells Redis
# what is the execution time, in microseconds, to exceed in order for the
# command to get logged, and the other parameter is the length of the
# slow log. When a new command is logged the oldest one is removed from the
# queue of logged commands.

# The following time is expressed in microseconds, so 1000000 is equivalent
# to one second. Note that a negative number disables the slow log, while
# a value of zero forces the logging of every command.
slowlog-log-slower-than 10000

# There is no limit to this length. Just be aware that it will consume memory.
# You can reclaim memory used by the slow log with SLOWLOG RESET.
slowlog-max-len 128

################################ LATENCY MONITOR ##############################

# The Redis latency monitoring subsystem samples different operations
# at runtime in order to collect data related to possible sources of
# latency of a Redis instance.
#
# Via the LATENCY command this information is available to the user that can
# print graphs and obtain reports.
#
# The system only logs operations that were performed in a time equal or
# greater than the amount of milliseconds specified via the
# latency-monitor-threshold configuration directive. When its value is set
# to zero, the latency monitor is turned off.
#
# By default latency monitoring is disabled since it is mostly not needed
# if you don't have latency issues, and collecting data has a performance
# impact, that while very small, can be measured under big load. Latency
# monitoring can easily be enabled at runtime using the command
# "CONFIG SET latency-monitor-threshold <milliseconds>" if needed.
latency-monitor-threshold 0

############################# EVENT NOTIFICATION ##############################

# Redis can notify Pub/Sub clients about events happening in the key space.
# This feature is documented at http://redis.io/topics/notifications
#
# For instance if keyspace events notification is enabled, and a client
# performs a DEL operation on key "foo" stored in the Database 0, two
# messages will be published via Pub/Sub:
#
# PUBLISH __keyspace@0__:foo del
# PUBLISH __keyevent@0__:del foo
#
# It is possible to select the events that Redis will notify among a set
# of classes. Every class is identified by a single character:
#
#  K     Keyspace events, published with __keyspace@<db>__ prefix.
#  E     Keyevent events, published with __keyevent@<db>__ prefix.
#  g     Generic commands (non-type specific) like DEL, EXPIRE, RENAME, ...
#  $     String commands
#  l     List commands
#  s     Set commands
#  h     Hash commands
#  z     Sorted set commands
#  x     Expired events (events generated every time a key expires)
#  e     Evicted events (events generated when a key is evicted for maxmemory)
#  A     Alias for g$lshzxe, so that the "AKE" string means all the events.
#
#  The "notify-keyspace-events" takes as argument a string that is composed
#  of zero or multiple characters. The empty string means that notifications
#  are disabled.
#
#  Example: to enable list and generic events, from the point of view of the
#           event name, use:
#
#  notify-keyspace-events Elg
#
#  Example 2: to get the stream of the expired keys subscribing to channel
#             name __keyevent@0__:expired use:
#
#  notify-keyspace-events Ex
#
#  By default all notifications are disabled because most users don't need
#  this feature and the feature has some overhead. Note that if you don't
#  specify at least one of K or E, no events will be delivered.

############################### ADVANCED CONFIG ###############################

# Hashes are encoded using a memory efficient data structure when they have a
# small number of entries, and the biggest entry does not exceed a given
# threshold. These thresholds can be configured using the following directives.
hash-max-ziplist-entries 512
hash-max-ziplist-value 64

# Similarly to hashes, small lists are also encoded in a special way in order
# to save a lot of space. The special representation is only used when
# you are under the following limits:
list-max-ziplist-entries 512
list-max-ziplist-value 64

# Sets have a special encoding in just one case: when a set is composed
# of just strings that happen to be integers in radix 10 in the range
# of 64 bit signed integers.
# The following configuration setting sets the limit in the size of the
# set in order to use this special memory saving encoding.
set-max-intset-entries 512

# Similarly to hashes and lists, sorted sets are also specially encoded in
# order to save a lot of space. This encoding is only used when the length and
# elements of a sorted set are below the following limits:
zset-max-ziplist-entries 128
zset-max-ziplist-value 64

# HyperLogLog sparse representation bytes limit. The limit includes the
# 16 bytes header. When an HyperLogLog using the sparse representation crosses
# this limit, it is converted into the dense representation.
#
# A value greater than 16000 is totally useless, since at that point the
# dense representation is more memory efficient.
#
# The suggested value is ~ 3000 in order to have the benefits of
# the space efficient encoding without slowing down too much PFADD,
# which is O(N) with the sparse encoding. The value can be raised to
# ~ 10000 when CPU is not a concern, but space is, and the data set is
# composed of many HyperLogLogs with cardinality in the 0 - 15000 range.
hll-sparse-max-bytes 3000

# Active rehashing uses 1 millisecond every 100 milliseconds of CPU time in
# order to help rehashing the main Redis hash table (the one mapping top-level
# keys to values). The hash table implementation Redis uses (see dict.c)
# performs a lazy rehashing: the more operation you run into a hash table
# that is rehashing, the more rehashing "steps" are performed, so if the
# server is idle the rehashing is never complete and some more memory is used
# by the hash table.
#
# The default is to use this millisecond 10 times every second in order to
# actively rehash the main dictionaries, freeing memory when possible.
#
# If unsure:
# use "activerehashing no" if you have hard latency requirements and it is
# not a good thing in your environment that Redis can reply from time to time
# to queries with 2 milliseconds delay.
#
# use "activerehashing yes" if you don't have such hard requirements but
# want to free memory asap when possible.
activerehashing yes

# The client output buffer limits can be used to force disconnection of clients
# that are not reading data from the server fast enough for some reason (a
# common reason is that a Pub/Sub client can't consume messages as fast as the
# publisher can produce them).
#
# The limit can be set differently for the three different classes of clients:
#
# normal -> normal clients including MONITOR clients
# slave  -> slave clients
# pubsub -> clients subscribed to at least one pubsub channel or pattern
#
# The syntax of every client-output-buffer-limit directive is the following:
#
# client-output-buffer-limit <class> <hard limit> <soft limit> <soft seconds>
#
# A client is immediately disconnected once the hard limit is reached, or if
# the soft limit is reached and remains reached for the specified number of
# seconds (continuously).
# So for instance if the hard limit is 32 megabytes and the soft limit is
# 16 megabytes / 10 seconds, the client will get disconnected immediately
# if the size of the output buffers reach 32 megabytes, but will also get
# disconnected if the client reaches 16 megabytes and continuously overcomes
# the limit for 10 seconds.
#
# By default normal clients are not limited because they don't receive data
# without asking (in a push way), but just after a request, so only
# asynchronous clients may create a scenario where data is requested faster
# than it can read.
#
# Instead there is a default limit for pubsub and slave clients, since
# subscribers and slaves receive data in a push fashion.
#
# Both the hard or the soft limit can be disabled by setting them to zero.

# Redis calls an internal function to perform many background tasks, like
# closing connections of clients in timeout, purging expired keys that are
# never requested, and so forth.
#
# Not all tasks are performed with the same frequency, but Redis checks for
# tasks to perform according to the specified "hz" value.
#
# By default "hz" is set to 10. Raising the value will use more CPU when
# Redis is idle, but at the same time will make Redis more responsive when
# there are many keys expiring at the same time, and timeouts may be
# handled with more precision.
#
# The range is between 1 and 500, however a value over 100 is usually not
# a good idea. Most users should use the default of 10 and raise this up to
# 100 only in environments where very low latency is required.

# When a child rewrites the AOF file, if the following option is enabled

# in order to commit the file to the disk more incrementally and avoid
