# 数据存储

_Object storage_ (also referred to as _object-based storage_) is a general term that refers to the way in which we organize and work with units of storage, called objects. Every object contains three things:

- **The data itself**. The data can be anything you want to store, from a family photo to a 400,000-page manual for assembling an aircraft.
- **An expandable amount of metadata**. The metadata is defined by whoever creates the object storage; it contains contextual information about what the data is, what it should be used for, its confidentiality, or anything else that is relevant to the way in which the data is used.
- **A globally unique identifier**. The identifier is an address given to the object in order for the object to be found over a distributed system. This way, it’s possible to find the data without having to know the physical location of the data (which could exist within different parts of a data center or different parts of the world).

Block Storage is persistant storage organized into unstructured "blocks", each the same length. An ordinary disk drive, RAID array, or USB storage key are examples of locally attached "block storage".

Block storage can be either "locally attached", or it can be "network" attached, in a SAN, speaking a network protocols such as iSCSI.

Block storage devices typically are formatted with a filesystem, such as Linux's ext3 or btrfs, or Microsoft's FAT32 or NTFS. The Linux filesystems such as ext3 implement the POSIX filesystem semantics.

In OpenStack, block storage is provided by the Nova system working with the Cinder system. When you start a Nova compute instance, it will probably come with some block storage devices by default, at the very least to hold the read/write partitions of the running OS. These block storage instances can be "ephemeral" (the data goes away when the compute instance stops) or "persistant" (the data is kept, can be used later again after the compute instances stops), depending on the configuration of the OpenStack system you are using.

A block storage device usually can be attached and in read/write use by only one machine or compute instance at a time.

Object Storage is persistant storage of "objects" in a way that is useful for HTTP access and for making guarantees about the safe storage of data. An object is a stream of bytes, with an associated name, a MIME type, an access control list (ACL), and other HTTP-related and random metadata. Once an object is created and written, it cannot be changed, only copied or deleted.

Object Store systems are often configured to make very strong guarantees that the data will not be lost, even in a disaster. Keeping three copies across two geographically separated datacenters is common.

Once written, an object can be read by many clients at once. If you want to "fan out" data: writing it once, and having it read many times by many machines in the near and far future, object storage can help implement that pattern.

With some care in the naming of an object, and by pointing the DNS CNAME of the domain name part of a URL at the address of an Object Storage service, the object can be retrieved and displayed by any web browser on the internet. A great deal of the content, especially graphics and icons, that display in your web browser, are actually objects being served out of Amazon's AWS S3 service.

In OpenStack, the object storage system is one of the two original projects, and is named Swift.

With block storage, files are split into evenly sized blocks of data, each with its own address but with no additional information (metadata) to provide more context for what that block of data is. You’re likely to encounter block storage in the majority of enterprise workloads; it has a wide variety of uses (as seen by the rise in popularity of SAN arrays).

Object storage, by contrast, doesn’t split files up into raw blocks of data. Instead, entire clumps of data are stored in, yes, an object that contains the data, metadata, and the unique identifier. There is no limit on the type or amount of metadata, which makes object storage powerful and customizable. Metadata can include anything from the security classification of the file within the object to the importance of the application associated with the information. Anyone who’s stored a picture on Facebook or a song on Spotify has used object storage even if they don’t know it. In the enterprise data center, object storage is used for these same types of storage needs, where the data needs to be highly available and highly durable.

However, object storage generally doesn’t provide you with the ability to incrementally edit one part of a file (as block storage does). Objects have to be manipulated as a whole unit, requiring the entire object to be accessed, updated, then re-written in their entirety. That can have performance implications.

Another key difference is that block storage can be directly accessed by the operating system as a mounted drive volume, while object storage cannot do so without significant degradation to performance. The tradeoff here is that, with object storage, the storage management overhead of block storage (such as remapping volumes) is relatively nonexistent.

## FileStorage VS Object Storage

more detail the differences between file and object. In file storage, when a file is stored to disk it is split into thousands of pieces, each with its own address. When that file is needed the user enters the server name, directory and file name, the file system finds all of its pieces and reassembles them. Little if any metadata information about the file is included. In object storage, that same file is stored as a single object complete with metadata, and is assigned an ID and stored as close to contiguously as possible. When content is needed all a user needs to do is present the ID to the system and the content will be fetched along with all the metadata, which can include security, authentication, etc. This can happen directly over the Web, eliminating the need for Web servers and load balancers.

## Block Storage VS File Storage

File Level Storage - This storage technology is most commonly used for storage systems, which is found in hard drives, NAS systems and so on. In this File Level storage, the storage disk is configured with a protocol such as NFS or SMB/CIFS and the files are stored and accessed from it in bulk.

The File level storage is simple to use and implement. It stores files and folders and the visibility is the same to the clients accessing and to the system which stores it. This level storage is inexpensive to be maintained, when it is compared to its counterpart i.e. block level storage. Network attached storage systems usually depend on this file level storage. File level storage can handle access control, integrate integration with corporate directories; and so on. "Scale Out NAS" is a type of File level storage that incorporates a distributed file system that can scale a single volume with a single namespace across many nodes. Scale Out NAS File level storage solutions can scale up to several petabytes all while handling thousands of clients. As capacity is scaled out, performance is scaled up.

Block Level Storage - In this block level storage, raw volumes of storage are created and each block can be controlled as an individual hard drive. These Blocks are controlled by server based operating systems and each block can be individually formatted with the required file system.

Block level storage is usually deployed in SAN or storage area network environment. This level of storage offers boot-up of systems which are connected to them. Block level storage can be used to store files and can work as storage for special applications like databases, Virtual machine file systems and so on. Block level storage data transportation is much efficient and reliable. Block level storage supports individual formatting of file systems like NFS, NTFS or SMB (Windows) or VMFS (VMware) which are required by the applications. Each storage volume can be treated as an independent disk drive and it can be controlled by external server operating system. Block level storage uses iSCSI and FCoE protocols for data transfer as SCSI commands act as communication interface in between the initiator and the target.

# Block Storage

From a use case standpoint, there are a lot of applications that make use of this block-level shared storage, including:

- **Databases.** This is especially true when you want to cluster databases, since clustered databases need shared storage.
- **Exchange.** Although Microsoft has made massive improvements to Exchange, the company still does not support file level or network-based (as in, CIFS or NFS) storage. Only block level storage is supported.
- **VMware.** Although VMware can use file level storage via Network File System (NFS), it's very common to deploy VMware servers that use shared VMFS volumes on block level storage.
- **Server boot.** With the right kind of storage device, servers can be configured to boot from block level storage.
